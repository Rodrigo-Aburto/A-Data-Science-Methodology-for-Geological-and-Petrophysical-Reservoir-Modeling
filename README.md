The notebooks contained in this repository are intended to work as complementary material to the thesis titled "A Data Science Methodology for Geological and Petrophysical Reservoir Modeling". The contents follow the methodology proposed to integrate Data Science methodology into the workflow of Geological-Petrophysical Reservoir Modelling. 

The notebooks contained here are separated by the family of the algorithm and the task they perform; even though they all share common steps, the idea is to have each one of them be as self-contained as possible.
